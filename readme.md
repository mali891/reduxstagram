# Reduxstagram

A fun little React + Redux experiment. Completed from Wes Bos' Learn Redux course.

## Running

First `npm install` or `yarn` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` or `yarn start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
